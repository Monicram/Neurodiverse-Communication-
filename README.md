# Neurodiverse Communication using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
Neurodiverse Communication is an NLP-based project designed to improve communication accessibility for neurodiverse individuals. It uses transformer-based models to paraphrase autism-style or non-standard language into clear, standard language while preserving the original intent.

The goal of this project is to bridge communication gaps using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.

## 🚀 Features
- NLP-based paraphrasing system
- Transformer model integration
- Converts neurodiverse-style utterances into standard language
- User-friendly web interface
- Flask-based backend
- Accessibility-focused AI solution

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Transformer Models  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS  
- Machine Learning
