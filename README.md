# Neurodiverse Communication using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
Neurodiverse Communication is an NLP-based project designed to improve communication accessibility for neurodiverse individuals. The system uses transformer-based models to paraphrase autism-style or non-standard language into clear, standard language while preserving the original intent.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.

## 🚀 Features
- NLP-based paraphrasing system
- Transformer model integration
- Converts neurodiverse-style utterances into standard language
- User-friendly web interface
- Flask-based backend
- Accessibility-focused AI solution

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Transformer Models
- Flask
- HTML, CSS
